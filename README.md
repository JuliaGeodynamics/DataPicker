# DataPicker
This provides some simple Makie tools that help to interactively pick data from 2D plots/cross-sections. It is predominantly developed to work with [GeophysicalModelGenerator](https://github.com/JuliaGeodynamics/GeophysicalModelGenerator.jl), but may be useful for some as a stand-alone application as well.
